# Universalis

A small project for my bachelor gradutate in Computer Science at UBI.
Using Python with PyQt, Selenium and SQLite.

For testing it, run 1st run.sh, the script should install (on Ubunto based OS) the required packages for good working.

For Windows, you should install:
1. Python on https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/
2. Get PIP on https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/install-pip-windows/
3. Get selenium, PyQt5 and criptography on pip. Ex. pip3 install selenium

Or:
Go to 1_Extras/Instalador.exe and install it

## Bases

- Python with:
 1. PIP, as a Package Manager
